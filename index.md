# We help bootstrap devopsdays events

We exist for two reasons

1. To lower the barrier of entry for running a [devopsdays](https://devopsdays.org/) conference in Australia.
2. Provide continuity between organising teams

Devops Australia provides:

1. Seed funding to pay deposits
2. Event insurance
3. A template budget
4. Template sponsorship packages
5. Coaching and support for organising teams

# We have supported devopsdays events in Australia since 2014

These events include:

- [Brisbane, 2014](https://legacy.devopsdays.org/events/2014-brisbane/)
- [Melbourne, 2015](https://legacy.devopsdays.org/events/2015-melbourne/)
- [Sydney, 2016](https://www.devopsdays.org/events/2016-sydney/)
- [Newcastle, 2018](https://www.devopsdays.org/events/2018-newcastle/)
- [Sydney, 2019](https://www.devopsdays.org/events/2019-sydney/)

# We need your help to run devopsdays events

**We need a volunteer team to run the next Australian devopsdays in 2019.**

You should volunteer to organise and run a devopsdays because:

1. It looks good on your resume
2. You'll exercise a different set of skills
3. It's an opportunity to give back to the community

**You just need to bring yourself** (or even better, a team).

Weâ€™ll help you with budget, venue, date, and sponsors.

### To volunteer, email us at `contact@devops.org.au`.

# The boring bits

Devops Australia is an incorporated association registered in Victoria, Australia.

[Our ABN](https://abr.business.gov.au/ABN/View?abn=35167927157) is `35 167 927 157`.

We don't run for profit, and are a team of five volunteers.
